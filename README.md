# Bellabeat-case-study---Google-data-analytics-capstone-project
Analyzed fitbit fitness data to gain insights fitness trends. Using those insights, provided recommendations to improve Bellabeat's marketing strategies and fitness app


SCENARIO: 
•	You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. 
•	The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. 
•	Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. 
•	From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 
•	But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
Note: The company Cyclistic is a fictional company being used only for this scenario.
About the comapny: 
•	In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. 
•	Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. 
•	The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. 
•	Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. 
•	One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. 
•	Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. 
•	Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Insights: 
	Members are more than casual riders in number.
	In all months, members are higher in number than casuals.
	In weekdays members are substantially greater in number than casuals.
	There is an increment in casual riders during the weekends.
	During the months of June, July and August there is an increment in the overall bike users.

How members differ from casuals:
Members are bigger in volume than casuals.
Casuals have higher ride durations despite being lower in number as compared to members.
Casuals rise in number during the weekends whereas throughout the weekdays, members are more.
Members seem to have a more fixed use for bike routines, whereas casuals are mostly on the weekends.

Top recommendations based on my analysis:
Offer weekend-only membership at a different price than annual membership.
Offer a summer discount or vouchers targeting both casuals and members, since during summer months the total number of riders is at its peak.
